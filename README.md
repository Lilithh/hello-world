to deal a crushing blowÔºÅ


First, let me write someting for memory:
Four score and seven years age, our father brought forth on this continent a new nation , consived in liberty, and dedicated to the preposation that all man are created equal . Now we are engaged in a great civil war , testing whether that nation , or any nation so consived and so dedicated can long wndoor. We are meet on a great battle filed if that war, we have come to dedicate a potion of that fild as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that nation might live.It is already fitting and proper that we shoud do this!
